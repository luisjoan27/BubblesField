# BubblesField
In this project, im trying to make a bubbles field which basically is just a empty space with the shape of a rectangle 
  with many bubbles(circles) bouncing between each other, inside the rectangle
  
  NOTE:
  
    1-  The program is not completed, it has a huge "BUG" when many bubbles start bouncing agaisnt each other(at the same time), and against the border of the field(the rectangle). 
  
    2-  I did not make any crazy physics formula in order to calc the bouncing angle, i just changed the objects direcction 
      whenever they touch each other.
      
    3-  The code has no comments in form of documentation which makes it very difficult to read, but 
        the variable names are pretty self-explanined. 
     
    4-  the code is dirty with many ideas and function that i never finished, but these are in comments form, and also some reduntancy.
  
  Purpose:
    
    1- could be interesting to have a moving background in a WebApp, which is not a video or gif or any kind of imagen.
    
    2- The main purpose is just to practice my JavaScript.
